            <p class="lead" style="float: right; margin-top: 20px;"> Here is the <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> of a large-scale email marketing campaign. I managed the complete redesign of this template, reaching hundreds of site visitors. In conjunction with our design team, I hand coded and designed the email invitation to be mobile-responsive and more user-friendly. The <strong>before</strong> version was heavy on content with an outdated look and feel. In the <strong>after</strong> version, we used a single column layout, a fun new graphic and updated our call-to-action button. Adding multiple events for a digest email was a breeze with this new template. Previously, we were sending emails for each individual event. Working closely with a marketing analyst, I was able to use dynamic content to target customers based on location and browsing behavior.</p>

            <p class="lead">This is the first iteration of a design for <strong>Caffe Delia</strong>, a local coffee shop based in Seattle, WA. They wanted Facebook and Twitter feeds and a mobile-responsive site that was true to the style of the physical shop. I used a simple grid framework to organize my code and Javascript to toggle the navigation bar on and off, as the site resizes. I used CSS3 rotate animation to create the Polaroid stacked images effect. </p>
